<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What is life ?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>-Characteristics&nbsp;</strong><strong>of life -</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Movement</strong> -all living things move in some way .</p>
<p><strong>Respiration</strong> -a chemical reaction that happens within cells to release energy from food. (transpiration- process of the gasses being changed and exchanged)</p>
<p><strong>Sensitivity</strong> &ndash; the ability to detect changes in the surrounding environment and respond and adopt&nbsp;&nbsp; to those change.</p>
<p><strong>Growth</strong> -an increase in the number of cells.</p>
<p><strong>Reproduction</strong> -the ability reproduce and pass genetic information onto their offspring either sexually or asexually.</p>
<p><strong>Excretion</strong> (state of homeostasis) -the action of disposing waste in the cells before they become toxic.</p>
<p><strong>Nutrition</strong> -intake and use of nutrients from the surroundings that is used for growth and providing energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>- Cells of living organisms -</strong></span></h2>
<p>All living things are made up of microscopic cells. Cells are the basic structure and functional unit of all living organisms . They are the smallest part of living organisms. They are the most important difference in structure of different cells is the presents of a nucleus. (cells with nucleus &ndash; <strong>eukaryotic</strong> , cells without nucleus &ndash; <strong>prokaryotic</strong> ). Plants and animals are made up of eukaryotic cells. Cells are are<strong> specialised</strong> to form special function which effect the shape, size or the different components compared to other cells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Some common structures in most cells include :</u></p>
<p><strong>Cell membrane : </strong>a thin layer that encloses the cells content and separates the cells from its environment. It controls which substances entre and exit the cells.</p>
<p><strong>Cytoplasm:</strong> the jelly-like substance the cells are filled with. It provides a liquid medium for all of the chemical reactions.</p>
<p><strong>Nucleus: </strong>It controls the processes and chemical reactions within the cell. It contains cell genetic materials which is organised into long DNA molecules.</p>
<p>*<strong>note</strong>* : prokaryotic DNA floats in the cytoplasm without a membrane.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>- Photosynthesis &amp; Respiration-</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Definition: </strong>photosynthesis is a series&nbsp;of chemical reactions in which gree plants convert radiant in the form of glucose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Primary purpose is to produce glucose as food and oxygen is the by-product. Plants are an essential part of life on earth as they are the only organism that is able to convert radiant to potential energy/food<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Photosynthesis_en.svg/220px-Photosynthesis_en.svg.png" /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Resources plants need for photosynthesis:</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Radiant energy </strong>(heat and light) from the sun</li>
<li><strong>Chlorophyll </strong>, green pigment found in chloroplast of plant cells that absorbs radiant energy.</li>
<li><strong>Water </strong>, plants absorb through roots</li>
<li><strong>CO2 </strong>(carbon dioxide) , plants absorb from the atmosphere through stomata.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Word equation:</u></strong></p>
<p>Carbon dioxide + water &nbsp;&agrave;glucose + oxygen</p>
<p><strong><u>Symbol / chemical equation:</u></strong></p>
<p>CO2 + H2O &agrave;C6H12O6 + 02</p>
<p><strong><u>Factors that affect the rates of photosynthesis:&nbsp; </u></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Light intensity</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide</li>
<li>Temperature</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Using and storing glucose </u></strong></p>
<p>Plants can use glucose directly or they can store it for use at a later time. Glucose is <strong>soluble</strong> in water which allows plants to transport glucose to where it&rsquo;s needed. Plants have to convert glucose into an <strong>insoluble</strong> compound to store it such as:</p>
<p>-<strong>starch </strong>is stored in seeds and fruits of plants as a food source.</p>
<p>-<strong>cellulose</strong> is a compound that plants use to make cell walls which provide support and strengthen the cell walls so they can build and form the plants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>- Cellular Respiration -</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> a series of chemical reactions in which energy is released from glucose.</p>
<p>Cellular respiration happens in all organisms in the mitochondrion (plural: mitochondria and needs oxygen and glucose to occur and produce carbon dioxide and water as by-products.</p>
<p><strong><u>Word equation:</u></strong></p>
<p>Glucose + oxygen &agrave; ATP + carbon dioxide + water</p>
<p><strong><u>Chemical equation: </u></strong></p>
<p>C6H12O2 +O2 &agrave; ATP + CO2 + H2O</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Diversity of life</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>- Terminology -</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Biodiversity: </strong>the variety of living organisms on earth, which includes species, genetic and ecosystem diversity.</p>
<p><strong>Indigenous: </strong>species that occur naturally, not as accidental or deliberate introduction (by man) in an area.</p>
<p><strong>Alien / exotic: </strong>they are species that are not indigenous to a specific area and that have been artificially introduced to that place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>- Classification -</strong></span></h2>
<p>Living &ndash; biotic</p>
<p>Non-living &ndash; abiotic</p>
<p>&nbsp;The practice of classifying organisms is called <strong>taxonomy</strong>. First begin with general and broad differences and then one systematically introduces more and more details and specific criteria. <strong>Dichotomous branching diagram</strong>/tree (broken down into 2) is a classification system.</p>
<p>Each organism is grouped into one of 5 large groups or kingdoms, which are classified into smaller groups called phyla ( singular: phylum) and then smaller and smaller groups. This process is shown in the schematic taxonomy diagram.</p>
<p>&nbsp;When identifying organisms write them using 2 part scientific names with the first word representing the <strong>genus</strong> and the second word representing the &nbsp;<strong>species</strong>. The genus name is always written with a capital letter and the species with a small letter. The scientific name must always be written in italic or underlined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>- Five kingdom system &ndash;</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The five kingdom system is currently the most common way of grouping living things :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Kingdom of Monera (bacteria)</li>
<li>Kingdom of Protista</li>
<li>Kingdom of Fungi</li>
<li>Kingdom of Plantae</li>
<li>Kingdom of Animalia</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Kingdom Monera</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>prokaryotic</li>
<li>unicellular organisms (consists of one cell only)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>Kingdom Protista </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>eukaryotic</li>
<li>can be unicellular or multicellular.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>Kingdom Fungi </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>unicellular or multicellular</li>
<li>non-motile (they can&rsquo;t move)</li>
<li>important as decomposers.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Kingdom Plantae </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>eukaryotic and multicellular</li>
<li>they are autotrophs (make their own food) using photosynthesis</li>
<li>are non-motile</li>
<li>store their food as starch in seeds and fruits.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Kingdom Animalia </u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>eukaryotic and multicellular</li>
<li>are motile and heterotrophs (can&rsquo;t make their own food).</li>
<li>can be divided into <strong>vertebrates </strong>(have backbone) and <strong>invertebrates</strong> (don&rsquo;t have backbone).</li>
</ul>
